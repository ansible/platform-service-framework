"""
URL configuration for this app.

This file defines URL patterns specific to this app. It is automatically loaded
by the platform-service-framework when the app is registered in `apps/settings.py`
under `project_applications`.

URLs defined here load at step 4 in the URL loading order, after `apps/urls.py`
(step 3). The order among apps follows the order in `project_applications`.

For full documentation, see: {{project_name}}/urls.py

## Example

    from django.urls import include, path

    from .v1 import urls as v1_urls
    from .views import SomeView

    urlpatterns = [
        path("api/v1/", include(v1_urls)),
        path("api/v1/some-endpoint/", SomeView.as_view(), name="some-endpoint"),
    ]
